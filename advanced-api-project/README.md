## Testing

### Testing Strategy

We use Djangoâ€™s built-in test framework to ensure the API endpoints for the `Book` model are functioning correctly. Tests cover CRUD operations, advanced query capabilities, and permission checks.

### Test Cases

1. **Create Book:** Verifies that a new book can be created and saved correctly.
2. **Read Book:** Ensures that retrieving a book by ID returns the correct data.
3. **Update Book:** Checks that updating a book reflects the changes in the database.
4. **Delete Book:** Confirms that a book can be deleted from the database.
5. **Filter Books:** Tests the filtering functionality based on various attributes.
6. **Search Books:** Validates that search functionality works as expected.
7. **Order Books:** Ensures that ordering works correctly based on specified fields.
8. **Permissions:** Tests access controls to ensure unauthenticated users are restricted.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py test api
